#
# $(FLUTTER_ENGINE_ROOT) is the variable pointing to the git checkout of the
# flutter engine. Here, the flutter engine path is relative to
# `flutter-desktop-embedding/linux`
#
# This variable will be used when building `example_flutter/` to pass the
# `--local-engine-src-path` flag to the flutter binary.
FLUTTER_ENGINE_ROOT ?=../../flutter-engine

# See above regarding building the flutter engine before editing these
# variables.
#
# $(FLUTTER_ENGINE_BUILD) refers to the `gn` configuration used to build the
# engine. When running `gn --unoptimized` to generate the build configuration,
# the variable should be set (as it is now) to `host_debug_unopt`. If building
# with the flags `--runtime-mode release`, then this variable will be set to
# `host_release`.
#
# A simple way to figure out how to set this flag is to check the output of `gn`
# and then set $(FLUTTER_ENGINE_BUILD) to be the name of the directory after `out/`
#
# Example output (from inside the $(FLUTTER_ENGINE_ROOT) directory):
#
#```
# $ ./src/flutter/gn --unoptimized
# gn gen --check in out/host_debug_unopt
# Done. Made 385 Targets from 168 files in 379ms
#```
#
# From the above, you should then set this flag to `host_debug_unopt`.
#
# See also: $(FLUTTER_ENGINE_GN_ARGS)
FLUTTER_ENGINE_BUILD ?=host_debug_unopt

# Args used when running the GN command:
#
# example of the default args (`--unoptimized`) when inside the
# $(FLUTTER_ENGINE_ROOT) dir:
#
#```
# $ ./src/flutter/gn --unoptimized
# gn gen --check in out/host_debug_unopt
# Done. Made 385 Targets from 168 files in 379ms
#```
FLUTTER_ENGINE_GN_ARGS ?=--unoptimized

# Args used when running ninja to build the engine (after the -C argument).
#
# This represents the bare minimum required to get the engine to run a
# Flutter application.
#
# If this variable is set to the empty string, then all engine targets will be
# built.
