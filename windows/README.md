# The Flutter Windows Desktop Embedder

This framework provides the basic functionality for embedding a Flutter app on
the Windows desktop.

This README assumes you have already read [the top level README](../README.md),
which contains important information and setup common to all platforms.

## Minimum Flutter Version

The minimum version of Flutter supported on Windows is
[32941a8](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/commit/32941a8cc0df5d7653a5c2c40ffb180c4db1c15d).

## Using the Library

Build the GLFW Library project in Visual Studio into a static or dynamic library,
then link `flutter_embedder.lib` and include `embedder.h` into your binary. Also
ensure that the `flutter_engine.dll`, and if using a dynamic library
`flutter_embedder.dll`, are in valid DLL include paths.

The output files are located in `bin\x64\$(Configuration)\GLFW Library\`.

## Example Application

The application under `example\` shows an example application using the
library.

You should be able to build the GLFW Example project in Visual Studio and have
access to `GLFW Example.exe` located in `bin\x64\$(Configuration)\GLFW Example\`.

The resulting binary expects to be run from this directory like so:

```
> ".\bin\x64\$(Configuration)\GLFW Example\GLFW Example.exe"
```

e.g.:

```
> ".\bin\x64\Debug Dynamic Library\GLFW Example\GLFW Example.exe"
```

or you can use Visual Studio's inbuilt debugger to build the library and run the
example application automatically.

## Caveats

* While GLFW is in use in the current iteration, this is not going to be the
  final state for Windows support.
* Text input does not work yet.
* Plugins are not currently supported.
