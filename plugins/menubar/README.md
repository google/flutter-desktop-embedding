# menubar

This plugin provides access to a native menubar.

This is a prototype, and in the long term will either be replaced by functionality
within the Flutter framework itself, or a published plugin (likely part of
flutter/plugins). Either way, the API will change significantly.

## Supported Platforms

- [x] Windows
- [x] Linux

macOS is no longer supported, since macOS menus are now supported by the Flutter
package now. See [PlatformMenuBar](https://master-api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/PlatformMenuBar-class.html) for more details.

## Use

See [the plugin README](../README.md) for general instructions on using FDE plugins.
