# This script does a command-line build of the Xcode project, with the
# build output in a 'macos' directory under the Flutter build directory.
#
# Having this file in this location, with this name, enables the current
# experimental 'flutter build' support for desktop.

# The output directory must be absolute, or Xcode will treat it as
# relative to each subproject.
