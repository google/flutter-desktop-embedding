description: A test project for flutter-desktop-embedding.

environment:
  sdk: '>=2.0.0 <3.0.0'
  # The testbed interacts with build scripts on the Flutter side that are not
  # yet stable, so it requires a very recent version of Flutter.
  # This version will increase regularly as the build scripts change.
