/// A controller that exposes a view of the union of a collection of sets.
///
/// This is a convenience class for creating a [UnionSet] whose contents change
/// over the lifetime of a class. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// class Engine {
///   Set<Test> get activeTests => _activeTestsGroup.set;
///   final _activeTestsGroup = new UnionSetController<Test>();
///
///   void addSuite(Suite suite) {
///     _activeTestsGroup.add(suite.tests);
///     _runSuite(suite);
///     _activeTestsGroup.remove(suite.tests);
///   }
/// }
/// ```

  /// Creates a set of sets that provides a view of the union of those sets.
  ///
  /// If [disjoint] is `true`, this assumes that all component sets are
  /// disjointâ€”that is, that they contain no elements in common. This makes
  /// many operations including [length] more efficient.

  ///
  /// If another set in [this] has overlapping elements with [component], those
