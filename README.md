# Desktop Embedding for Flutter

This purpose of this project is to support building
applications that use [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter)
on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

It consists of libraries that implement [Flutter's embedding
API](https://github.com/flutter/engine/wiki/Custom-Flutter-Engine-Embedders),
handling drawing and mouse/keyboard input, as well as
optional plugins to access other native platform functionality.

## How to Use This Code

### Setting Up

The tooling and build infrastructure for this project requires that you have
a Flutter tree in the same parent directory as the clone of this project:

```
<parent dir>
  ├─ flutter (from http://github.com/flutter/flutter)
  └─ flutter-desktop-embedding (from https://github.com/google/flutter-desktop-embedding)
```

Alternately, you can place a `.flutter_location_config` file in the directory
containing flutter-desktop-embedding, containing a path to the Flutter tree to
use, if you prefer not to have the Flutter tree next to
flutter-desktop-emebbing.

### Repository Structure

Each supported platform has a top-level directory named for the platform.
Within that directory is a `library` directory containing the core embedding
library, and an `example` directory containing an example application using it.

See the `README` file in the directory corresponding to your platform for more
details.

In addition, there is:
* `example_flutter`: The Flutter application loaded by the example application
  provided for each platform.
* `plugins`: Plugins which provide access to additional platform functionality.
  These follow a similar structure to [Flutter
  plugins](https://flutter.io/developing-packages/). See the
  [README](plugins/README.md) for details.
* `third_party`: Dependencies used by this repository, beyond Flutter itself.
* `tools`: Tools used in the development process. Currently these are used
  by the build systems, but in the future developer utilities providing
  some functionality similar to the `flutter` tool may be added.

## Flutter Application Requirements

Because desktop platforms are not supported Flutter targets, existing Flutter
applications are likely to require slight modifications to run.

### Target Platform Override

Most applications will need to override the target platform for the application
to one of the supported values in order to avoid 'Unknown platform' exceptions.
This should be done as early as possible.

In the simplest case, where the code will only run on desktop and the behavior
should be consistent on all platforms, you can hard-code a single target:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart'
    show debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride;
[...]

void main() {
  debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride = TargetPlatform.fuchsia;
  [...]
}
```

If the code needs to run on both mobile and desktop, or you want different
behavior on different desktop platforms, you can conditionalize on `Platform`.
For example, the line in `main()` above could be replaced with a call to:

```dart
/// If the current platform is desktop, override the default platform to
/// a supported platform (iOS for macOS, Android for Linux and Windows).
/// Otherwise, do nothing.
void _setTargetPlatformForDesktop() {
  TargetPlatform targetPlatform;
  if (Platform.isMacOS) {
    targetPlatform = TargetPlatform.iOS;
  } else if (Platform.isLinux || Platform.isWindows) {
    targetPlatform = TargetPlatform.android;
  }
  if (targetPlatform != null) {
    debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride = targetPlatform;
  }
}
```

Note that the target platform you use will affect not only the behavior and
appearance of the widgets, but also the expectations Flutter will have for
what is available on the platform, such as fonts.

### Fonts

Flutter applications may default to fonts that are standard for the target
platform, but unavailable on desktop. For instance, if the target platform is
`TargetPlatform.iOS` the Material library will default to San Francisco, which
is available on macOS but not Linux or Windows.

Most applications will need to set the font (e.g., via `ThemeData`) based
on the host platform, or set a specific font that is bundled with the
application. The example application demonstrates using and bundling Roboto
on all platforms.

Symptoms of missing fonts can include text failing to display, console logging
about failure to load fonts, or in some cases crashes.

## Feedback and Discussion

For bug reports and specific feature requests, you can file GitHub issues. For
general discussion and questions there's a [project mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/flutter-desktop-embedding-dev).

When submitting issues related to build errors or other bugs, please make sure
to include the git hash of the Flutter checkout you are using. This will help
speed up the debugging process.

## Caveats

* This is not an officially supported Google product.
* This is an exploratory effort, and is not part of the Flutter project. See the
  [Flutter FAQ](https://flutter.io/faq/#can-i-use-flutter-to-build-desktop-apps)
  for Flutter's official stance on desktop development.
* Currently the development workflow assumes you are starting from an existing
  native application shell, and provides the pieces to add Flutter support. This
  is very different from the Flutter model, where the native application
  projects are created automatically. This may change in the future, but for now
  there is no equivalent to `flutter create`.
* Many features that would be useful for desktop development do not exist yet.
  Check the `plugins` directory for support for native features beyond drawing
  and event processing. If the feature you need isn't there, file a feature
  request, or [write a plugin](plugins/README.md#writing-your-own-plugins)!
