# Desktop Embedding for Flutter

This project was originally created to develop Windows, macOS, and Linux
embeddings of [Flutter](https://github.com/flutter/flutter). That work has
since become part of Flutter, and all that remains here are experimental,
early-stage desktop
[plugins](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/packages-and-plugins/developing-packages).

If you want to get started with Flutter on desktop, the place to start is now
[the Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/desktop), rather than this project.
You will already need to have followed the instructions there to get an application
running on desktop before using any of the plugins here.

## Feedback

**Do not file issues about Flutter for desktop here.** Since the
embeddings have all moved to the Flutter project, the place for desktop bugs
and feature requests is now [the Flutter issue
tracker](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues).

For bug reports and feature requests **related to the plugins in this repository**,
please file issues here.

## Repository Structure

The `plugins` directory contains all the plugins. See
[its README](plugins/README.md) to get started.

`testbed` is a a simple test application for the plugins above.

## Caveats

* This is not an officially supported Google product.
