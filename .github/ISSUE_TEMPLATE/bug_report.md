*** Important Note ***
Development of Flutter for Desktop is now primarily happening in the Flutter repository itself. If you have a bug or feature request related to desktop that's about the Flutter framework, the `flutter` command-line tool, or the desktop support in the Flutter engine, please file your issue in the Flutter issue tracker: https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues

Please file bugs here only for things specific to this repository:
* Instructions in the READMEs here.
* Bugs specific to the example application here.
* Bugs specific to the plugins here.

If you're not sure whether the issue is in the code here or in Flutter itself, you can file your bug here, but we may close the issue and ask you to file it in Flutter if it turns out not to be related to this code that's part of this project.
