# This script downloads a specific version of FlutterEmbedder.framework, which
# is the prebuild Flutter engine framework for macOS. By default it pulls the
# version to fetch from a Flutter tree, but that can be overridden by
# $FLUTTER_ENGINE_VERSION_OVERRIDE.
# 
# Currently the script assumes that the Flutter tree is in the same directory
# as this respository, and that the downloaded file should be stored in a
# "flutter_engine_framework" directory next to both of them.
# TODO: Make the script more flexible about paths.
